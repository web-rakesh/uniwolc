          <h5>Uniwolc Processing Fee</h5>
          <p>We are committed to helping applicants from any part of the world access the opportunity for education. At the same time, we want to ensure we deliver students with a high chance of visa approval. Accordingly, Uniwolc will collect a mandatory $250 CAD processing fee (the “Processing Fee”) from any applicant that meets any one of the following criteria as defined by Uniwolc (which are subject to change from time to time in Uniwolc sole discretion):</p>
          <ul>

            <li>If an applicant has been refused a visa from Canada, the USA, the United Kingdom, New Zealand or Australia (these countries share biometric information with each other);</li>
            <li>If an applicant is pursuing the same or lower level of education. e.g. the applicant has a bachelor’s degree and wants to pursue an undergraduate degree;</li>
            <li>If an applicant is pursuing a non-related educational field. e.g. the applicant has a game design degree and is pursuing a Master of Laws; or</li>
