                        <h3>Strong International Education Rebound in 2021–2022</h3>
                        <p>In 2021, the Canadian government processed more than 550,000 new student visa2 applications,
                            easily surpassing the record 425,000 processed in 2019.3 2022 is primed to smash 2021’s numbers,
                            with more than 450,000 applications already processed through the end of August.4</p>
                        <p>The United Kingdom has seen a similar boom. Nearly 450,000 students applied for a sponsored study
                            visa in 2021, up from 290,000 in 2019. And another 140,000 applications were submitted in the
                            first half of 2022, 80% more than in the same period last year.5</p>
                        <p style="color: #5D4BDC;"><strong>On the Uniwolc Platform, there was a 250% rise in UK applications
                                submitted between January and September 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Australia’s borders remained closed to international travel until mid-December 2021. Though there
                            were concerns its international education sector would be slow to recover, early signs are
                            positive. More than 213,000 Australian student visa applications were lodged from January to
                            August 2022, almost 25% more than the same period in 2019.6</p>
                        <p>If there’s a laggard among the top English-language destination markets, it’s the United States.
                            The US government processed just under 450,000 student visa applications for its 2021 fiscal
                            year,7 below the nearly 490,000 processed in fiscal year 2019. But 2022 may be more promising.
                            At Uniwolc, US applications spiked by 200% from January to September 2022 compared to the same
                            period last year.</p>
                        <h3>Processing Delays Leave Students in Limbo</h3>
                        <p>So many students vying to study abroad has put strain on the international education ecosystem.
                            Governments have struggled to manage the influx of applications, leading to processing delays
                            that have kept students in limbo for months and, in some cases, forced them to defer their
                            studies.</p>
                        <p>Canada’s total visa backlog reached 2.1 million in June, due in part to the Canadian government’s
                            efforts to relocate refugees from the Ukrainian crisis.8 Amid this backlog, average student visa
                            processing times hovered between 11 and 13 weeks throughout 2022 after falling as low as seven
                            weeks in 2021.9 And for certain countries, processing times have been much higher. For example,
                            processing times for Sri Lankan students reached 26 weeks in September.</p>
                        <p>In the US, estimated wait times for a student visa interview appointment climbed steadily over
                            the course of the year before falling sharply in September. But like Canada, significant
                            outliers remain. Remarkably, wait times of over a year remained for select Indian cities in
                            October. The US government authorized consular officers to waive the in-person requirement for
                            category F visa applicants through the end of 2022, but applicants must meet specific criteria
                            to qualify for a waiver.10</p>
                        <p>Facing its own visa processing delays, the UK government pointed to its own efforts to support
                            Ukrainian refugees as contributing to the backlog.11 In June, the British High Commissioner to
                            Nigeria implored applicants to apply for their study visa well ahead of when they might have in
                            previous years.12 In August, the government restored certain priority visa services, suspended
                            without warning in March, allowing students to pay a premium for faster visa turnaround times.13
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #5D4BDC;"><strong>By October, average processing times for UK study visas sat at
                                three weeks—significantly less than those for the other major English-language
                                markets.</strong></p>

                                <p>Australia Faced Backlogs Of Five To Nine Months While Its Borders Were Closed.14 However,
                                    The Australian Government Has Made Significant Investments To Expedite Visa Processing,
                                    Adding 140 New Staff In May.15 Currently, The Government Advises Students To Lodge Their
                                    Applications At Least Six To Eight Weeks Before Course Commencement.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Australian government’s willingness to invest in better visa processing is an encouraging
                            sign for the sector. While the post-COVID boom will not last indefinitely, the ability to
                            deliver shorter visa processing times—as we’re currently seeing from the UK—is likely to be a
                            key point of competitive differentiation across markets moving forward. International students
                            are eager to begin their education abroad as soon as possible, particularly those who put their
                            plans on hold during the pandemic.</p>
                        <h3>Student Visa Approval Rates a Key Differentiator</h3>
                        <p>For some international applicants, the long wait for visa processing ends in disappointment. This
                            is less of a concern in the UK and Australia, where candidates less likely to secure a visa are
                            typically triaged out at the institution stage, and government approval rates are upwards of
                            90%.</p>
                        <p>For Canada and the US, however, significant numbers of students are refused a student visa. From
                            2016 to 2018, approval rates for Canadian and US students visas were roughly on par, hovering in
                            the mid to high 60s. But since 2019, US approval rates have been consistently higher than
                            Canadian rates. In 2021, the US F-1 student visa approval rate hit 80%, its highest since 2013.
                            Canadian students, meanwhile, had just a 60% approval rate in 2021, and that rate fell to 57%
                            over the first six months of 2022.</p>
                        <div class="sub-trends-report-chart">
                            <img src="assets/images/01-trends-report-chart.jpg" alt="" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Students have taken notice of these challenges. In the October edition of Uniwolc Pulse Survey,
                            66% of recruitment professionals surveyed said that visa processing times and approval rates
                            were a top concern for their students. US institutions would be well served to highlight this
                            advantage over their counterparts in Canada as they continue to rebuild their international
                            enrollment post-pandemic.</p>
                        <h3>Affordability, Post-Graduate Work Top Concerns Among Students</h3>
                        <p>A global recession looms over many economic projections for 2023. In October, the International
                            Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth forecast for next year to 2.7%, down 0.2
                            percentage points from its summer projection.16 The 2023 forecast is the weakest growth profile
                            since 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the COVID-19
                            pandemic—arguably the two largest periods of financial uncertainty within the past 20 years.17
                        </p>
                        <p>A new study from the World Bank Group also suggests that the global economy is edging toward a
                            recession in 2023, and that a string of financial crises could create lasting damage to key
                            markets.18</p>
                        <p style="color: #5D4BDC;"><strong>“Global growth is slowing sharply, with further slowing likely as
                                more countries fall into recession. My deep concern is that these trends will persist, with
                                long-lasting consequences that are devastating for people in emerging markets and developing
                                economies.”</strong></p>
                        <p style="color: #5D4BDC;"><strong>— David Malpass, President, World Bank Group</strong>
                        <h3>Affordability Concerns Paramount with Recession Looming</h3>
                        <p>Against this global economic backdrop, Uniwolc Pulse Survey asked counsellors what aspects of
                            studying abroad their students were most concerned about when choosing where to study.
                            Affordability issues dominated the results. More than 85% of respondents cited cost of studying
                            as a concern for their students. This was the most commonly occurring concern, followed by
                            post-graduation work opportunities (80%) and cost of living (73%). These results are
                            unsurprising, as high inflation and rising interest rates have dominated financial news around
                            the world throughout 2022.</p>
                        <p>Surveys of prospective international students have produced similar results. Across four of five
                            priority markets for US institutions, students indicated that cost of living was their number
                            one concern about studying abroad.19 Similar results held for the UK20 and Canada.21 For
                            Australia and New Zealand, four out of the top five worries students expressed about studying in
                            a different country are related to affordability. Cost of living (74%) was number one, followed
                            by availability of scholarships (65%), safety (55%), getting a job (49%), and finding
                            accommodations (49%).22</p>
                        <p>Uniwolc exclusive internal data also reflects the concerns students have about the affordability
                            of studying abroad. In 2019, 60% of searches on the Uniwolc Platform were for programs with
                            tuition fees of over 50,000 per year.23 But by 2021, this fell to 29%. Student willingness to
                            spend is up slightly in 2022. Even so, two out of every three students on our platform searched
                            for tuition fees below 50,000 per year. In short, even as students are once again on the move in
                            large numbers, they remain less willing (or able) to pay high tuition fees today than they did
                            before the onset of the pandemic.</p>

                        <p>How do these widespread concerns about affordability affect destination market competitiveness?
                            Uniwolc Pulse Survey asked counsellors which major English-language destination markets were
                            more attractive from an affordability standpoint. Canada was the clear winner, with 87% of
                            respondents saying they felt that studying and living in the country was affordable for
                            international students. Canadian institutions should consider highlighting this
                            advantage—particularly those located in more affordable regions of Canada, such as the Prairies
                            and Atlantic provinces.</p>
                        <h3>Strength of American Dollar Will Impact Affordability</h3>
                        <p>Another macroeconomic trend impacting the international education ecosystem? The soaring value of
                            the American dollar. Shockingly, the euro fell below parity with the USD in August.24 The US
                            Dollar Index—which measures the value of the dollar relative to six other major foreign
                            currencies—reached highs in 2022 not seen since the turn of the century. While a strong US
                            dollar is good news for traveling Americans and students already living and working stateside,
                            it also means that newer students relying on personal savings may find their home currency no
                            longer goes as far in the US as it once did.</p>
                        <p>This currency shift means that American institutions and policymakers will need to monitor their
                            market closer than ever before. There is a strong opportunity for the sector to grow its
                            reputation for supporting students through these tough financial times by offering scholarships.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the same time, competing destination markets like Australia and Canada could leverage the
                            strong USD to appeal to students who find their budgets suddenly unable to accommodate the
                            shifting currency value. Likewise, with the euro falling below parity with the USD and the
                            British pound potentially not far behind,25 the EU and UK may be more affordable destinations
                            than before. As the only Anglophone country remaining in the EU, Ireland seems likely to be a
                            major beneficiary.</p>

                        <h3>Post-Graduation Work Opportunities an All-Important Driver</h3>
                        <p>Post-graduation work opportunities remain a key consideration for students choosing between
                            destination markets. As mentioned above, 80% of our recruitment partner network indicated that
                            post-graduation work opportunities are a top consideration for their students. Other surveys
                            have found that nearly half of all students intend to stay in their destination market to work
                            after graduation.26</p>
                        <p>With post-graduation work opportunities of such paramount importance to students, the generosity
                            of these programs offers a key opening for destination markets to get a leg up on the
                            competition.</p>
                        <p>Canada’s Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows international graduates to stay and
                            work in Canada for eight months to three years, depending on the length of their study program.
                            The PGWPP is particularly highly regarded.27 When surveyed, 97% of Uniwolc recruitment partners
                            agreed that Canada provides strong post-graduation work opportunities for their students.</p>
                        <p>The program’s sky-high approval rate may be a factor. More than 97% of eligible PGWPP applicants
                            were approved between January of 2016 and July of 2022.</p>
                        <p style="color: #5D4BDC;"><strong>Please rate your level of agreement with the following statement:
                                This country provides strong post-graduation work opportunities for my students.</strong>

                        <p>In Australia, the Post-Study Work stream allows international students who’ve recently graduated
                            with a degree from an Australian institution to live, work, and study in Australia for two to
                            four years, depending on their qualification.28 However, the Australian government announced in
                            September that graduates in select sectors will be eligible to stay and work for an extra two
                            years.29 This change makes Australia’s post-graduation work program the most generous among the
                            four main English-language destination markets, and may well push Australia ahead of its
                            competitors when it comes to attracting international talent.</p>
                        <p>The introduction of the Graduate Route (GR) in the UK helped propel international student
                            enrollment growth by 8% in 2020/21.30 Incredibly, this helped the UK reach its 2030 goal for
                            international student enrollment nine years ahead of schedule. And there’s room for even further
                            growth: in student surveying, nearly 60% of prospective students said they would be more likely
                            to consider studying in the UK if international students could remain in the country for three
                            years instead of two.31</p>
                        <p>The US trails other markets with respect to post-study work rights. The Optional Practical
                            Training (OPT) program extends for just one year for most students, with science, technology,
                            engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students eligible for a two-year extension. Beyond this, the
                            transition from OPT to a permanent residency pathway is a particularly difficult one.
                            Nevertheless, OPT is well subscribed, with more than 200,000 international graduates working
                            under the program in the 2021 academic year.32 In January, the Biden administration took steps
                            to make OPT more accessible to international students by making 22 additional STEM sub-fields
                            eligible for the two-year OPT extension.33 </p>

                        <h3>Destination Markets Alleviating Work Barriers for International Students</h3>
                        <p>The expansion of post-graduation work opportunities is exciting to see. But new and current
                            students often need to work part-time to pay for their tuition and living expenses. How
                            destination markets support these efforts is another key area of differentiation.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian government recently lifted the 20-hour weekly limit for international students
                            authorized to work off-campus.34 There are more than half a million international students in
                            Canada, and this change will not only help increase their weekly income and alleviate cost of
                            living pressures, but also increase their work experience and possibly help prepare them for
                            later career success.35</p>
                        <p style="color: #5D4BDC;"><strong>These policy changes are sure to be welcome news for students,
                                their parents, and employers across Canada, making it an important improvement that will
                                keep Canada top of mind for international students and competitive as a nation looking to
                                attract top talent.</strong></p>

                        <p>Like Canada, Australia has temporarily relaxed the working hours cap for student visa holders.
                            But this relaxation will end on June 30, 2023.36 This means that working hours will once again
                            be capped for students following this date. In the UK, international students are capped at 20
                            hours of work per week during the school term.37 The US also caps working hours for
                            international students at 20 hours per week.38 Although Canada’s relaxation of its working hours
                            cap is scheduled to end on December 31, 2023, these changes should boost the country’s
                            reputation as accommodating to student needs, thereby giving the country a competitive
                            recruitment edge over other destination markets over the next year.</p>
                        <h3>Global Need for Workers Driving Competition for International Students</h3>
                        <p>If destination markets are expanding post-graduation work opportunities, does that mean
                            international students are well positioned to fill gaps in the job market? Job vacancies reached
                            record levels while unemployment rates fell to multi-decade lows nearly across the board in
                            2022.39 This means that organizations experienced a growing need for workers, but faced a
                            shrinking pool of available talent to hire. While this trend will likely shift in 2023 due to
                            the looming recession, for many high-skill positions, student recruitment should remain a vital
                            component in filling those roles.</p>
                        <p>This is perhaps most evident in the healthcare industry. Tragically, the World Health
                            Organization (WHO) estimated that between 80,000 and 180,000 health and care workers lost their
                            lives due to COVID-19 between January 2020 and May 2021, a figure that has likely risen in the
                            year and a half since.40 Other healthcare workers have sought out new sectors for employment.
                            These losses have contributed to a global crisis in which nations face a shortage of healthcare
                            workers.41 Recruiting professionals from one country to another will not solve this
                            crisis—instead, new workers need to be trained.</p>
                        <p>Encouragingly, this need may be starting to reach the ears of prospective students. Searches for
                            fields related to the health industry on the Uniwolc Platform jumped 3.8 percentage points in
                            2022 compared to 2020. Searches for science programs rose by 3.7 percentage points over the same
                            period. But business programs still account for nearly one-third of searches, and further
                            incentives may be needed to get international students into high-need careers. The time may be
                            ripe for other governments to follow the US in offering extended post-graduation work rights for
                            STEM students. </p>

                                <p>Whether or not international students hold the key to solving the labour shortage across
                                    destination markets, many will leave their home country to live, work, and study far
                                    away. With this in mind, it’s important to take a closer look at student mobility not
                                    just from the perspective of destination markets, but from source markets as well.</p>
                                <p>Any conversation about source markets begins with China and India. While emerging markets
                                    will be critical means of diversifying student inflows moving forward, by virtue of
                                    their sheer size, China and India will continue to dominate as the top two sources for
                                    international students.</p>
                                <p>That said, the two markets are headed in opposite directions. China’s population of young
                                    adults (aged 18 to 23) declined by nearly 50 million between 2010 and 2020, and it’s
                                    expected to shrink by another 35 million by 2050.42 At the same time, the Chinese
                                    government is actively working to develop their post-secondary education systems and
                                    institutions, transitioning China from a top source market to a destination market of
                                    its own.</p>
                                <p>India, on the other hand, has become home to the largest population of young adults
                                    worldwide, with more than 150 million in 2020. Though the Indian young adult demographic
                                    is expected to decline somewhat over the next 30 years, India is still projected to
                                    become the world’s largest middle class consumer market by 2030.43 And near-term
                                    economic projections for India are more favourable than those for China, as well as the
                                    Eurozone and Latin America.</p>
                                <p>The rise of the middle class in India will enable more Indian students to consider
                                    studying abroad, and this massive population of students seeking to further their
                                    education will drive recruitment conversations for years to come.</p>

                                <p>These shifts are already having an impact on student inflows to top English-language
                                    destination markets. Indian student inflows to Canada surpassed Chinese student inflows
                                    in the mid-2010s, and as of December 31, 2021, there were more than twice as many Indian
                                    holders of Canadian study permits as there were Chinese holders.</p>
                                <p>In contrast, the news that more Indian students than Chinese students were granted UK
                                    sponsored study visas between July 2021 and June 2022 surpassed the expectations of most
                                    across the sector. And indeed, the rate at which the gap between the two countries
                                    closed is remarkable. As recently as 2019, China sent 80,000 more students to the UK
                                    than India. While the total number of Chinese students in the UK still greatly outpaces
                                    the number of Indian students, the gap is narrowing.44</p>
                                <p>A similar phenomenon has taken place in the United States. The US Department of State
                                    issued more F-1 student visas to Indian nationals than Chinese nationals in the 2020
                                    fiscal year, and while China surpassed India again in 2021, the margin was less than
                                    10,000 students. In 2019, the gap was more than 60,000 students; in 2015, it was nearly
                                    200,000. Like the UK, the total number of Chinese students in the US remains well ahead
                                    of the total number of Indian students, but the divide is shrinking.45</p>
                                <p>The number of Australian student visas granted to Indian nationals surpassed 37,000 in
                                    the 2018-19 Australian government fiscal year, more than double the total in 2015-16.46
                                    At the same time, the number of student visas granted to Chinese nationals declined to
                                    just under 52,000, the first year-over-year drop since 2011-12. But Indian student
                                    inflows to Australia fell more sharply than Chinese inflows during the pandemic, bucking
                                    a trend seen elsewhere around the world. Last year, more than twice as many Chinese
                                    nationals were granted an Australian student visa as Indians.</p>

                        <p>It’s important to note that the more recent decline in Chinese students going abroad matches a
                            larger pattern across the rest of East Asia. Fewer students from the region have gone abroad to
                            study since the onset of the pandemic, perhaps due to stricter lockdown measures or more
                            uncertainty about travelling. But while we may be in line for a small bump in Chinese student
                            outflows as COVID-19 fades even further into the rear view mirror, expect the underlying
                            demographic trends to eventually prevail—and the competition for students to grow even more
                            intense. </p>
                        <p>What does the international education ecosystem look like with India at the top? Chinese students
                            have repeatedly emphasized institution ranking and reputation as key drivers when choosing where
                            to study. For Indian students, graduate outcomes are paramount.47 Expect post-graduation work
                            opportunities and career success metrics like graduate employment rate to become even more
                            salient in the sector as Indian students dominate.</p>
                        <h3>Key Markets Emerging in Earnest</h3>
                        <p>In last year’s trends report,48 we identified six high-growth-potential markets that we felt were
                            ready to expand and that remained relatively untapped by institutions in each destination
                            market. Those markets were Nigeria, Kenya, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, and Indonesia. While our
                            forecasts were (and remain) intended to be long term, we feel it’s worth briefly reviewing the
                            performance of some of these markets to see how their international student populations have
                            shifted over the past year.</p>

                        <p>We remain excited about Nigeria, Pakistan, and Bangladesh as high-growth markets. While the UK is
                            the clear leader in all three markets at present, institutions in other destination markets
                            would be well served to direct recruitment efforts to these countries with growing young adult
                            populations, developing economies, and overtaxed domestic education systems.</p>
                        <h3>The Long View</h3>
                        <p>So far in this report, we’ve focused on key trends we see impacting international education right
                            now, and how governments and institutions can respond to shifting student preferences in order
                            to ensure they can remain competitive in an increasingly challenging landscape. But some of the
                            most profound shifts happening in our sector will play out over years, if not decades.</p>
                        <p>In this section of the report, we look at a pair of trends we see as having a longer horizon. We
                            begin with technological innovations we see taking hold in the medium term.</p>
                        <h3>Momentum for Online Delivery Stalled, but Hybrid Viable</h3>
                        <p>While online programs were gaining momentum prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 and 2021 saw an
                            explosion in digital course offerings. With international students unable or unwilling to
                            travel, governments demonstrated flexibility by allowing students to begin their international
                            education from their home country while remaining eligible for post-graduation work rights.</p>
                        <p>With pandemic restrictions waning, students have made a welcome return to the physical classroom.
                            In a June 2022 Institute of International Education survey, 89% of US institutions reported that
                            the majority of their international students were once again studying on campus.55</p>
                        <p>What does that mean for the future of online learning in international education? Quacarelli
                            Symonds (QS) student surveying in early 2022 found that across markets, just 1 in 5 students
                            were considerably interested in online or distance learning.56 This was broadly consistent with
                            previous findings, suggesting that the pandemic failed to expand the long-term viability of the
                            purely virtual learning model. When asked to explain why they weren’t keen on online delivery,
                            students pointed to a lack of access to university facilities, wanting to meet other students,
                            and wanting to live overseas while studying.</p>
                        <p>There remains considerably more interest in a hybrid or blended learning approach, which combines
                            in-person instruction and online delivery. 65% of candidates surveyed by QS indicated that they
                            would find this approach either somewhat or very appealing, citing the convenience of studying
                            from any location and the advantage of being able to study while working.</p>
                        <p>If hybrid delivery is to gain a real foothold post-pandemic, we believe it will be through
                            students’ wallets. With the lifting of weekly work hour caps across select destination markets,
                            students may elect to pursue additional time on the job—particularly as affordability concerns
                            mount. Institutions could alleviate those financial concerns further by lowering tuition rates
                            for online or hybrid programs, which many international students have reported would make them
                            reconsider online studies.</p>

                        <h3>New Competition from Non-Anglophone Destination Markets</h3>
                        <p>When it comes to recruiting students, the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia will face growing
                            competition from destination markets outside the English-speaking world in the coming years.</p>
                        <p>International students began returning to China this fall after being shut out of the country for
                            more than two years due to COVID-19 border restrictions. However, China’s zero-COVID policy,
                            which has included harsh lockdowns and disruptive repeat-testing policies, remains in place.57
                            China hosted almost 500,000 international students as recently as 2019, and while its ongoing
                            restrictions may make for a slower recovery than countries such as Australia, we expect a full
                            rebound in the coming years.</p>
                        <p>Russia enacted a strong international student recruitment plan over the past five years. From
                            2016 to 2021, the number of international students in Russia grew from under 300,000 to nearly
                            400,000.58 Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 severely destabilized the sector, however,
                            with safety concerns paramount and sanctions limiting students’ ability to access funds from
                            back home.59 Volatility in Russia may open up recruitment opportunities for the big
                            English-language destination markets in Eastern Europe and Central Asia if institutions are
                            willing to invest in those regions.</p>
                        <p>A record 350,000 international students were registered at German universities in Winter
                            2021/22.60 This marked an 8% increase from the previous year. Germany’s greatest competitive
                            advantage is its free tuition for all students, but there are signs this perk could vanish.
                            Earlier this year, the state government of Bavaria granted public universities the right to
                            charge fees to non-EU international students, but complexities implementing the new rules have
                            preserved the status quo for now.61</p>
                        <p>Other, smaller destination markets that have seen significant international student growth over
                            the past 5 to 10 years and which have shrinking or stable domestic student populations62 include
                            Italy, Spain, Japan, and the Netherlands. The development of these markets will increase
                            competition for international students worldwide, even as new emerging markets provide larger
                            student populations.</p>

                                <p>In this report, we’ve touched on a wide range of factors that have driven international
                                    education trends post-pandemic and which will influence the sector in the years to come.
                                    But this report is not meant to be exhaustive. Many of the trends we’ve discussed are
                                    more complex than we’ve outlined here. Others which we’ve barely scratched the surface
                                    on may prove more influential than anyone predicted.</p>
                                <p>In this era of increasing student choice in international education, one thing is
                                    absolutely certain: With unemployment rates at historic lows and job vacancy rates at
                                    historic highs, success in attracting the best and brightest international students
                                    means more success in the larger global competitive sphere.</p>
                                <p>More than anything else, the countries and institutions that succeed in bringing in top
                                    talent will be those that prioritize student success. Look for governments to continue
                                    to craft policies that facilitate student mobility, whether by investing in more staff
                                    to alleviate visa processing slowdowns, or by offering more generous post-graduation
                                    work opportunities. And look for institutions to revisit their international recruitment
                                    strategies to gain a global edge, including by strengthening ties to industry and by
                                    pursuing more flexible learning models.</p>
                                <p>As for Uniwolc, we’ll continue to provide key data insights and forecasts across markets.
                                    Over the coming weeks and months, we’ll be releasing detailed articles and analyses that
                                    expand on some of the topics we discussed in this report.</p>
